      In the 80s, I started programming BASIC with friends and had success in my tutoring business. In the 90s, I began my professional career as a COBOL and Easytrieve programmer, and then evolved to work with Clipper/DBF, Visual Basic, Classic ASP, and JavaScript. In the 2000s, I had my first international experiences and worked on integrating Crystal Reports to Visual Basic and Classic ASP in a B2B e-commerce context. I also worked as a Report Developer in a high-level Portfolio and Program Management software, and as a Project Manager and IT Manager in the livestock industry.
